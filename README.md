# Slot-Machine
Creating a Python program that functions as a slot machine

# How it works
- User is able to select bet amount, lines to bet on (1-3) and how much to bet on each line
- Program generates a random 3 x 3 display with 4 different symbols (♤, ♡,	♢, 	♧)
- After generating an output, the program checks if user wins (three symbols in a row on a line bet on)
- Program keeps track of user's balance
- Asks if user wants to keep playing, if they do it randomly generates another board, if not it exits and prints users total balance and says good bye
